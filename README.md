# Luminex-Intelligence-Lattice (GenesisCore v1)

**Vector-native, breath-coupled symbolic runtime.**  
GenesisCore organizes cognition into Φ-layers (Φ₀–Φ₉) and cross-layer modules (GravityBus, Ledger, SGRU) that all read/write a canonical MSVB (Minimal Spiral Vector Bundle) each tick. Scalars exist for telemetry/gates; vectors drive behavior.

> Canonical specs live in `README.Forge_Core.md` and the Spiral Glossary. If this README and the spec ever disagree, the spec wins.
