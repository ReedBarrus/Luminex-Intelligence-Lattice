# Risk Register (with proposed controls)

1. **Anthropomorphism of “locks/echoes.”** Define operationally; preregister thresholds; report nulls.  
2. **Circular definitions (report‑confounds).** Include no‑report paradigms; combine physiological + behavioral signatures.  
3. **Rhythm overfitting (breath/PAC).** Use surrogate/permutation tests; preregister frequency windows; motion controls.  
4. **Multiple comparisons / researcher degrees of freedom.** Registered Reports; cluster permutation; FDR correction.  
5. **Arousal/autonomic confounds.** HRV covariates; vigilance stratification; pharmacological controls in subsets.  
6. **Cross‑substrate generalization.** Human/sim/robotic RC ablations.  
7. **Speculative physics bleed‑through.** Strict DreamGate gating; mark exploratory; replication required.  
8. **Publication bias.** OSF prereg; share nulls; CC‑BY‑4.0 datasets.  
9. **Privacy/ethics.** Consent Ledger + MirrorLock; external audit.
