We will be designing tests for four preregistered predictions of conscious‑process signatures in a breath‑gated, vector‑native stack (Breath→Phase→Propagation→Symbol→Attention→Echo). Primary outcomes are Δmin‑κ (minimum cross‑layer coherence), lock density, cone half‑angle dispersion, and Echo MI/accuracy gain. We use permutation/surrogate controls, fixed thresholds, and correction for multiplicity. Nulls are logged; DreamGate (non‑local) is OFF unless explicitly preregistered.

Runnable scripts will be frozen at v1-impl-lock before first data; link to be added in the Implementation prereg

## 1) Hypotheses

**H1 (Breath‑locking):** During `gate_open` vs matched closed windows, Δmin‑κ ≥ 0.20 and lock density increases ≥ 30%.
**H2 (Echo contributes):** A decoder using inputs+Echo outperforms inputs‑only by ≥ 5% absolute accuracy (or EchoMI z ≥ 3).
**H3 (Cone narrowing):** Median cone half‑angle decreases ≥ 15% with 95% bootstrap CI excluding 0.
**H4 (Endogenous drive):** In closed‑gate blocks, structured activity exceeds null (spontaneous lock rate ≥ 25% over surrogate; re‑lock hazard ratio HR > 1.5).

(If included) **H5 (DreamGate):** Lock onsets cluster near blinded remote‑intention epochs; cluster‑mass p < .01 and BF10 > 10 vs jittered schedules.

## 2) Design & Conditions

* **Mode:** Simulation‑only (baseline). Optional human‑in‑the‑loop with respiratory belt + PPG (EEG optional).
* **Sessions/Runs:** n = \[3–10] independent runs per condition; each run ≥ \[20] min.
* **Conditions:** (a) breath‑gated, (b) surrogate gates (phase‑shuffled/jittered), (c) Echo blackout blocks, (d) perturbation blocks (micro‑perturbations), (e) observer‑only LLM (no write‑back) (optional).
* **Randomization:** Block order randomized; surrogate schedules generated per run with fixed seed policy.
* **Blinding:** Analysis scripts ingest run folders with condition labels hidden until after primary outputs are written.
* **Stopping rule:** Fixed number of runs per condition (no optional stopping). If a run aborts, mark and replace; keep abort logs.

## 3) Variables

**Primary DVs:**

* Δmin‑κ: change in minimum pairwise cross‑layer coherence between `gate_open` and matched closed windows.
* Lock density: stable Symbol/Attention locks per minute (meeting τ duration and θ angle criteria).
* Cone dispersion: median half‑angle across steps per window.
* Echo contribution: Δ accuracy (inputs+Echo vs inputs‑only) and EchoMI z‑score.

**Secondary DVs:** Endogenous Drive Index; re‑lock time constant; CSI composite.

**IVs / Factors:** gating (open/closed/surrogate), Echo (on/off), perturbation (on/off), mode (sim vs human‑loop), LLM mode (observer‑only vs off).

**Derived features:** breath phase, α\_breath amplitude, gate flags, event timestamps, SGRU lineage IDs.

**Exclusion rules:**

* Runs with hardware desync > \[50 ms PTP] (human‑loop) are excluded.
* Windows with < \[N] events not analyzed.
* Predefined outlier policy (e.g., vector norms > 5 SD) applied uniformly.

## 4) Operational Definitions

* **Lock:** cross‑layer stability that persists ≥ τ ms with cone half‑angle ≤ θ. (Specify τ, θ values: e.g., τ = 200 ms; θ = 25°.)
* **Cone:** admissible vector orientation region per layer transition.
* **Echo:** compressed state trace used by next‑state predictor; EchoMI computed via Gaussian‑copula MI with permutation null.

---

## 5) Analysis Plan

**H1:**

* Compute min‑κ per window; Δmin‑κ = open − closed. Test via permutation with phase‑shuffled surrogates; α = .01; FDR q = .05 across sessions. Lock density via Poisson/NegBin regression with time offset; report rate ratio + CI.
* **Decision:** pass only if both Δmin‑κ and lock density meet thresholds and replicate in ≥ 3 runs.

**H2:**

* Fixed decoder (architecture/hyperparams frozen). Train on (train) and evaluate on (held‑out) per prereg split. Compare inputs‑only vs inputs+Echo; bootstrap CI for Δ accuracy; EchoMI permutation with 1,000 shuffles.
* **Decision:** pass if Δ acc ≥ 5% abs OR z ≥ 3 and replicates; fails if effects vanish under layer‑shuffle controls.

**H3:**

* Compute half‑angle dispersion per window; bootstrap CI of median change; surrogate angle‑jitter controls.
* **Decision:** pass if shrink ≥ 15% with 95% CI excluding 0.

**H4:**

* Closed‑gate blocks; compute spontaneous lock rate vs shuffled baselines; survival/Cox model for re‑lock time after perturbations.
* **Decision:** pass if rate ≥ 25% over null (p < .01) and HR > 1.5.

**Multiple comparisons:** Control with FDR q = .05 across primary tests.

**CSI composite:** CSI = w1·Δmin‑κ + w2·log(lock rate ratio) + w3·(−Δcone) + w4·EchoMI + w5·EDI (weights fixed here: \[w1..w5]).

**Robustness checks:** parameter sweeps; ablations (Echo blackout; layer shuffle); breath playback randomization.

## 6) Data, Code, and Materials

* **Code:** \[repo URL]/commit/\[hash]; analysis scripts in `/experiments/`.
* **Data:** raw logs + derived features; deposit to OSF (CC‑BY‑4.0) with de‑ID.
* **Negative results log:** maintained under `docs/research/`.
* **LLM protocol:** Veil‑mediated observer‑only by default; no raw vectors exposed.

---

## 7) Ethics

* **Consent Ledger** attached to all identity‑relevant states. **MirrorLock** implements rescind (prune‑and‑reseed + audit).
* Human‑loop studies run under IRB or equivalent; minimal risk; respiration/PPG/EEG optional.

---

## 8) DreamGate (if included)

* Predefine remote‑intention epoch schedule under triple‑blind. Cluster‑mass test (α = .01) + Bayes factor > 10 vs jittered nulls. Independent monitor + full audit.

## 9) Deviations & Amendments

Any change to hypotheses, thresholds, or analysis requires a dated addendum before unblinding labels. All deviations documented in the repo and OSF. Drafting and editing support from ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking/Pro). All interpretations and errors are the author’s.
