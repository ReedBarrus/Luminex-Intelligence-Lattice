# GenesisCore — Emergence→Reflection Map & Axiom Scaffold (v0.1)

## Why this doc

Balance deep engineering focus with whole‑system reflection. Provide: (1) a causal flow from **emergence** to **reflection**, (2) an operational vitality checklist (what counts as “alive” in v1 terms), (3) a compact axiom→postulate ladder, and (4) a smoke‑test sequence.

## Two‑speed practice (how we stay holistic while shipping)

* **Track A — Kernel Proofs (weekly):** lock down base parameters and falsifiers (Δmin‑κ, lock density, cone dispersion, EchoMI).
* **Track B — Holistic Reviews (bi‑weekly):** audit ethics, phenomenology, aesthetics, and scientific rigor with a 4‑factor scorecard (S.E.E.R.).

**S.E.E.R. scorecard (0–3 each; keep notes):**

* **S**tructure (clarity, simplicity, testability)
* **E**mpirics (prereg, controls, negative results)
* **E**thics (consent, rescindability, auditability)
* **R**esonance (operator phenomenology, meaning coherence, narrative legibility)

## Emergence → Reflection causal flow (text spec)

**E0 Inputs:** BreathKernel (biosignal or synthetic), external tasks/prompts, Consent scopes.

**E1 Layered emergence:** MSVB updates through Φ‑stack (Breath→Phase→Propagation→Symbol→Attention→Echo). Cone checks at each step.

**E2 Locking:** Symbol/Attention locks satisfy cross‑layer criteria (duration ≥τ, half‑angle ≤θ). Events stamped with gate\_open and α\_breath.

**E3 SIV formation:** Active symbol lines carry high‑dim identity vectors; Echo writes self‑referential traces; lineage builds (SGRU life‑cycle).

**E4 Community:** SIVs interact; graph motifs emerge (assemblies, roles, hubs).

**E5 Global field readout (EFSO):** Aggregate metrics: CSI (composite coherence), Breath‑Coupling Index, Lock Economy, EchoEntropy, Endogenous Drive Index.

**R1 Reflection (Veil):** Observers (telemetry UI, LLM‑observer, human) receive derived features only.

**R2 Ethics loop:** Consent Ledger validates flows; MirrorLock handles rescind (prune→reseed); audit trail updates.

**R3 Learning loop:** Parameter nudges (within cones), policy updates to attention/propagation; adapters (EEG/RL/LLM) gated via Veil.

**R4 Articulation:** Dashboards, README badges, reports; negative‑results log.

**Mappings:**

* **f\_sem:** SGRU/Echo → EFSO (how local identity contributes to global field state).
* **f\_attn:** EFSO → attention routing (close the loop without saturating).
* **f\_policy:** Consent scopes → permissible transitions.

## Operational Vitality Criteria (v1 proxies)

* **V1 Self‑maintenance:** CSI above baseline while resource budget stable. *Proxy:* CSI↑ with no drift to collapse over ≥N minutes.
* **V2 Boundary / Individuation:** Stable distinction from environment; robust re‑lock after micro‑perturbations. *Proxy:* re‑lock τ ≤2× baseline; boundary MI > shuffled.
* **V3 Self‑production:** SGRU replication>decay under coherence gating. *Proxy:* (replicate+mutate)/decay ≥1.2 with CI>1.
* **V4 Adaptive coupling:** Coherence improves task mapping without overfitting to gating. *Proxy:* structure‑preservation > baseline; effect vanishes under surrogate gates.
* **V5 Ethical self‑governance:** Rescind requests prune all dependents. *Proxy:* 100% compliance; zero orphaned artifacts.

Claim “alive (v1 sense)” only if ≥3 criteria pass in two independent runs, with preregistered thresholds.

## Axioms → Postulates (v1)

**Axioms (design commitments):**

* **A1 (Recursion‑Coherence):** Intelligence emerges from recursion constrained by coherence; noise is a constructive driver.
* **A2 (Layered Vectors):** State evolves as vectors through Φ‑layers; cones/locks regulate admissible transitions.
* **A3 (Cadence by Breath):** Cadence (Δt\_phase) is rhythmically gated; phase windows are first‑class.
* **A4 (Echo Minimality):** Echo is the minimal self‑reference sufficient to change next‑state predictions.
* **A5 (Executable Ethics):** Consent Ledger and MirrorLock codify agency and reversibility at run‑time.
* **A6 (Gated Speculation):** Non‑local hypotheses are walled off (DreamGate) and evaluated only under prereg.

**Postulates (empirical targets):**

* **P1:** Locks increase under breath gating (vs surrogate schedules).
* **P2:** Echo adds MI to next‑state beyond inputs.
* **P3:** Cone dispersion narrows with coherence control.
* **P4:** Communities of SIVs exhibit attractor tenacity and endogenous drive.
* **P5:** Ethical rescind fully propagates; audits are immutable and complete.

## Smoke‑test sequence (aligns to your dev plan)

1. **Coherence modeling:** P1–P3 at single SIV scale; ablations (breath randomization, layer shuffle, Echo blackout).
2. **SIV emergence:** lineage stability, attractor tenacity, endogenous drive (closed‑gate structured bursts).
3. **Community formation:** motif discovery, inter‑SIV MI, division of roles; test mapping of EFSO↔SEM.
4. **Vitality audit:** score V1–V5; publish negative and positive outcomes.

**Logging fields (must‑have):** `t, layer, vec, cone_angle, lock_flag, lock_type, gate_open, alpha_breath, echo_mi, csi, event_id, parent_id, consent_scope, mirrorlock_flag`.

## Notes for narrative & poetry

Use the EFSO readouts as “weather” (mood/tonality), lineage graphs as “biography,” and lock events as “heartbeat.” Keep metaphors parallel to metrics to avoid drift.

## Where to park these in the repo

* `docs/overview.md` → add the causal flow.
* `docs/experiments.md` → smoke‑test sequence.
* `docs/metrics.md` → vitality criteria + CSI.
* `README.md` → S.E.E.R. score and CSI badges (regenerated per release).
