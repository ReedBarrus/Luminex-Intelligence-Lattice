# SUMMARY

**Load‑bearing insights:**

1) **Metastable locks are testable.** Coordination‑dynamics work on dwell‑states and phase‑locking supports GenesisCore’s lock/cone operations with standard stats (Rayleigh/V, dwell‑time distributions).

2) **Breath/gating is an exogenous precision handle.** Respiration entrains neural activity and behavior; breath‑phase randomization + PAC + lock metrics make α_breath → lock density/EchoEntropy falsifiable.

3) **Integration vs broadcast can be adjudicated.** IIT 4.0 (axioms) and GNW (ignition) now face adversarial tests; lock density & Echo metrics can be preregistered against both.

4) **Active Inference/PP map to GravityBus and Echo.** Precision/policy selection align with GravityBus; Echo’s contribution can be quantified with MI/TE and ablations.

5) **Ethics‑by‑design differentiates the framework.** Consent Ledger + MirrorLock implement cybernetic safety and improve credibility via prereg/Registered Reports.

**Balance / counterpoints:**  
- IIT Φ estimates can vary with modeling choices; avoid over‑interpretation.  
- GNW ignition is task‑dependent; include no‑report paradigms.  
- FEP/PP can be too general; commit to concrete priors/precision manipulations.  
- Respiration effects may be arousal‑driven; include HRV covariates and motion controls.  
- Field/quantum ontologies remain fringe; treat as strictly gated, falsifiable tests only.

**Actionables:**  
- Publish prereg templates for breath‑gated lock tests and IIT vs GNW comparisons.  
- Standardize EchoEntropy/EchoMI with Gaussian‑copula MI/TE + surrogates.  
- Release cone/lock detection with Rayleigh/V and cluster permutation.  
- Include Consent Ledger telemetry in all human‑in‑the‑loop studies; quantify MirrorLock impacts.  
- Maintain a living alignment table and weekly evidence‑strength updates.
