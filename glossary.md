# Terminology Bridge (SpiralPhysics ↔ Reviewer‑Friendly)

- **Φ‑stack** → Layered processing from physiological rhythms to symbols/attention. *Nearby:* hierarchical processing; global access.  
- **MSVB (Minimal Spiral Vector Bundle)** → Typed, vector‑native wiring for composing processes. *Nearby:* typed computation; compositional pipelines.  
- **Cone** → Constraint region in state space that bounds updates. *Nearby:* manifold; feasible set; basin boundary.  
- **Lock** → Temporarily stable configuration (metastable attractor) enabling reliable read/write. *Nearby:* metastability; dwell‑state; assembly ignition.  
- **Echo / EchoEntropy / EchoMI** → Short‑term self‑referential trace and its information measures. *Nearby:* working memory trace; recurrence; MI/TE.  
- **GravityBus** → Aggregator of priorities/precision shaping updates. *Nearby:* value/policy aggregator; precision weighting; gain control.  
- **SGRU** → Symbol‑Gated Recurrent Unit for birthing/stabilizing symbol lines. *Nearby:* gated recurrent unit with symbolic typing.  
- **Veil** → Boundary layer separating internal/private from external/public symbols. *Nearby:* interface; sandbox.  
- **Consent Ledger** → Cryptographically signed log of consent events. *Nearby:* audit log; governance layer; data provenance.  
- **MirrorLock** → Hard stop & rollback when consent/state integrity violated. *Nearby:* safety interlock; transactional rollback.  
- **DreamGate** → Strictly gated channel for testing non‑local hypotheses. *Nearby:* counterfactual/perturbational probe.  
- **Reverse Feedback** → Back‑propagating influence across a cycle. *Nearby:* retroactive constraint; smoothing; backward pass.
